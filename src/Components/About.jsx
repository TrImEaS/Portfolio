            I initially started studying accounting, but I've always been interested in programming. Since I was 4 years old, I've had a computer, and <strong className="text-cyan-300">English and coding have always fascinated me</strong>. I used to think it was extremely difficult, reserved for a select few, and would be impossible for me. Until one day, I did some research and enrolled in a <strong className="text-cyan-300">computer science degree</strong>.

            <strong className="text-cyan-300">I learned my first language C, basically in 3 days</strong>. That's when I realized it wasn't as complicated as I had thought. I kept learning, <strong className="text-cyan-300">delving into Java with Junit, MySQL for databases, and then my favorite language, JavaScript</strong>. Once I got to know it, I didn't stop‚Äîventuring into <strong className="text-cyan-300">React, Node with Express, Sequelize and others technologies</strong>. Essentially, I wanted to master JS. Nowadays, I could say there's still some way to go, but the important thing is that I learned that anything one sets their mind to can be achieved, just like in programming‚Äî<strong className="text-cyan-300"> anything you can imagine can be coded</strong>.
